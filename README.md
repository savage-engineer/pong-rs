# pong-rs

Just a simple pong-like game built as a learning exercise in Rust/SDL2.
Code is in no way meant to be clean or even necessarily idiomatic - this project is simply to get the grasp of library bindings and syntax (and have a bit of fun with game dev). If something is a pretty bad code smell, it's probably because I either don't know the Rust idiom or I decided that having a quick and dirty solution would let me move along faster and achieve my main goal (having a "completed" project which isn't a trivial CLI util).
