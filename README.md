# pong-rs

Just a simple pong-like game built as a learning exercise in Rust/SDL2.
This is largely "finished" and was really done as a learning exercise for Rust syntax, program structure and a brief induction to working with SDL2 (even if through Rust bindings). The quality of the code is poor, but as it's a game project I am leaving it at "it does the job" because I mainly wanted to have something simple to show for now.
